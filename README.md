CHPL views AI as one tool among many that can support workflows and improve customer experience. AI solutions will only be adopted with rigorous adherence to best practices and ethical approaches. This includes the continuous reevaluation of AI tools and how they fit, and do not fit, at the library.  

## Ethics and AI Use

The use of AI at CHPL will continuously strive to achieve the following:

1. **Transparency**:  Openly share methodologies and AI application workflows whenever possible. 

1. **Staff Workflow Enhancement**: Employ AI to support and enrich staff functions, ensuring technology acts as an aid to human expertise and decision-making. 

1. **Content Labeling**: Clearly label AI-generated content as appropriate. 

1. **Legal and Ethical Compliance**: Adhere to the evolving standards set by relevant authorities, with a continued commitment to respecting and honoring the established code of ethics of organizations like the American Library Association (ALA) and the State Library. Ethical considerations include patron privacy, authors and other creatives, and partner institutions.
